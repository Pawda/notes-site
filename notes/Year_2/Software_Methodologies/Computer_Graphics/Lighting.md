# Shading

-   Generally, the process for re-creating the phenomenon where colour
    differ from surface to surface due to lighting

-   In CG, shading is the process of altering the colour of an
    object/surface/polygon, based on

    -   The type of light source that is emitting light

    -   How the light is reflected from object surfaces and enters the
        eye

    to create a photo realistic effect

# Normal Vector

-   The orientation of a surface is specified by the direction
    perpendicular to the surface and is called a normal (normal vector)

-   A surface has a front and back face, each side has its own normal

# Types of shading

Flat shading

-   Assign a single colour to each face (triangle) of an object

Gouraud (smooth shading)

-   Apply lighting against the normal vector at each vertex to calculate
    the vertex colour (vertex shader)

-   Colours across a face are generated by interpolating colours
    obtained at the corner vertices of the face (rasterisation)

Phong Shading

-   Normal vector at each point over an object surface is obtained by
    interpolating normal vectors of the corner vertices of the surface
    (rasterisation)

-   Colouring of each surface point will be calculated by applying
    lighting against the interpolated normal vector at the point
    (fragment shader)

# Types of light source

<Definition name="Directional light">
Like the sun that emits light naturally (from very far away, generating parallel light rays)
</Definition>

<Definition name="Point light">
Like a light bulb that emits light artificially in all directions from a point
</Definition>

<Definition name="Ambient Light">
Represents indirect light, that is, light emitted from all light sources and reflected by walls or other
</Definition>

# Types of reflected light

-   Illuminate objects: How light is reflected by the surface of an
    object and then enters the eye

-   Colour of the surface determined by:

    -   Type of the light (colour and direction)

    -   Type of surface of the object (colour and orientation)

Surface colour by diffuse and ambient reflection = surface colour by
diffuse reflection + surface colour by ambient reflection

## Ambient reflection

-   Ambient reflection is reflection of light from indirect light
    sources

-   Illuminates an object equally from all directions with the same
    intensity, its brightness is the same at any position

Surface colour by ambient reflection = light colour $\times$ base colour
of surface

## Diffuse reflection

-   Reflection of light from a directional light or a point light

-   Light is reflected equally in all directions from where it hits (due
    to rough surface)

-   $\theta$: Angle between light direction and surface orientation
    (direction "perpendicular" to the surface)

Surface colour by diffuse reflection = light colour $\times$ base colour
of surface $\times \cos\theta$

### Calculating $\cos\theta$

$\cos\theta$ is derived by calculating the dot product of the light
direction and the orientation of a surface

$\cos\theta$=light direction $\cdot$ orientation of a surface

# Using a point light object

-   In contract to a directional light, the direction of the light from
    a point light source differs at each position in the 3D scene

-   So, when calculating shading, you need to calculate the light
    direction at the specific position on the surface where the light
    hits

-   Light direction changes: pass the position of the light source and
    then calculate the light direction at each vertex position
