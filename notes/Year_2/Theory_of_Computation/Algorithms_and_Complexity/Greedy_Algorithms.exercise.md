Let $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ be two positive function defined on the natural numbers. Suppose there exist constance $c>0$ and $n_0$ such that $f(n_1)\leqslant cg(n_0)$. Which statement below can we deduce from this

1. $f(n)=\mathcal{O}(g(n))$
2. $f(n)=\Omega(g(n))$
3. $f(n)=\Theta(g(n))$
4. Each of the above can be deduced
5. None of the above can be deduced

</Question>
<Answer>

5 as the statement has been given in $n_0$, which is a constant, rather than n, so there is nothing we can say about the time complexity
