System testing is much more concerned with conformance to the
specification (requirements) than with finding bugs. Precedes and
underpins UAT

- Unit testing and integration testing are concerned with whether the
  coding conforms to the design

- System testing is concerned with whether the design conforms to the
  requirements

Steps in system testing include:

1.  Function testing

2.  Performance testing

3.  Acceptance testing

4.  Installation testing

# Function tests

- Driven by the list of requirements

- Can be documented in a tabular form by listing the requirement and
  then recording how it has been tested and the outcomes of that test

- Can form a preliminary stage for UAT, ensuring that the system works
  and that it conforms to the requirements as stated. UAT then
  assesses whether the stated requirements are the real ones

# Performance tests

Address the non functional issues such as

- Security

- Speed

- Accuracy

- Reliability

The ordering here is important. It is a good principle to get the system
working then address these issues.
