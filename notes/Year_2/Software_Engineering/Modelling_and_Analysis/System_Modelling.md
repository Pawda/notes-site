title: System Modelling
---

System modelling helps the analyst to understand the functionality of
the system and models are used to communicate with customers

Different models present the system from different perspectives

- **External** perspective showing the systemâ€™s context or environment

- **Behavioural** perspective where you model the dynamic behaviour of
  the system and how it responds to events and processes data

- **Structural** perspective showing the system or data architecture

A model helps with getting an abstract idea of the objects that the
software product will consist of and their interactions

A model is easy to change

Can be easily explained to non-technical audiences

Can be used to measure against requirements
