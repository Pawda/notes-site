# Why standards?

-   Quality

-   Shared communication

-   Shared understanding

-   Influence, from understanding to creation/development

-   Profit

-   Collaboration

-   Reputation

-   Regulation (assurance)

-   Flexibility

# Importance

-   They encapsulate best practice (normally)

-   Framework for QA

-   Provide continuity

    -   Record of decision making process

    -   Organisational memory

    -   New staff save time

# Issues

-   Standards are considered too large, unwieldy and difficult to adopt
    for SMEs

-   Focus is on large organisations

-   Concerns over cost and documentation

-   Difficult to justify

# Software standards

Standards are about providing rules, guidelines and heuristics which, if
followed, deliver an assurance of good practice - they are not intended
to be about best practice

Standards may be international, national, organisational or project
standards.

Standards of particular interest

-   ISO 9000, family of standards for quality management systems

-   ISO 12207, defines the software engineering process, activity, and
    tasks that are associated with a software life cycle process from
    conception through retirement

-   ISO 15504, also known as SPICE (Software Process Improvement and
    Capability Determination), is a framework for the assessment of
    processes

# ISO 9000

QSM:

-   ISO9001 – QSM for Quality Assurance in design, development,
    production, installation and service

-   ISO9002 – QSM for Quality Assurance in production, installation, and
    servicing

-   ISO9003 – QSM for Quality Assurance in final inspection and test

Quality: refers to all features of a product (such as software) which
are required by a customer

Quality management: covers the organisations approach to ensuring that
it produces quality products and complies with the appropriate
regulations

# ISO 12207

-   Created to supply a common structure so that the buyers, suppliers,
    developers, maintainers, operators, managers and technicians
    involved with the software development use a common language

-   It is the standard that defines all the tasks required for
    developing and maintaining software

-   Created in ’95, last updated in ’17 (ISO 12207:2017)

-   Covers the process in the life cycle of software:

    -   High level process architecture

    -   Activities and tasks

    -   Tailored for any organization or project (inc. SME et al)

    -   An ‘inventory’ of processes from which to choose

-   This standard does not create a standardised way to create a product

-   It is not prescriptive

-   Nor does it advocate or enforce a standardised methodology

## ISO 12207:17

# Process Implementation

-   Define or select software life cycle model appropriate to the scope,
    magnitude, and complexity of the project;

-   Select, tailor, and use standards, methods, tools, and programming
    languages (if not stipulated in contract);

-   Develop plans for conducting the activities of the Development
    process.

# ISO 15504

Process assessment: What is it?

-   A disciplined examination of the processes by an organisation
    against a set of criteria to determine capability of those processes
    to perform within quality, cost and schedule goals

-   Focus here is on continual, self-improvement

Why bother?

-   Identify strengths and weaknesses in current utilisation of
    processes

-   Ongoing development of systems, maturity and growth

-   Feeds into the future
