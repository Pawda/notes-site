<Definition name="Technical Debt">
A form of risk, and one that needs to be recognised and managed when designing
</Definition>

Designing involves using abstraction to help:

- Model our design solution in terms of the essential aspects

- Separate the logical and physical aspects of a solution

- Make decisions where there are choices

The ultimate criterion for any decision should be fitness for purpose,
in that a design should be well structures, should do its job well, and
have no unnecessary features.

# Knowledge Schemas

Schematic knowledge complements knowledge about the domain and about
syntax and semantics, and relates to the way ideas about possible
solutions are organised in memory.

Schematic knowledge is typically transferred via:

- Plan driven design methods

- Design patterns

- Software Architectures

# Some complications

Significant problems that we encounter and must cope with when designing
software are that

- It has both static and dynamic characteristics

- We need to use static forms of description to model these
  characteristics

- Software is invisible, and so we have no intuitive ways of
  visualising its form or describing it diagrammatically

# The outcomes of designing

The outcome of the design process is usually in the form of a model or
plan which can be used to guide the task of implementation, and that
describes

- The characteristics of the set of elements that will make up the
  "solution"

- Structure (how these elements are related to one another)

- How the elements will interact when the system is executed

The form of the model reflects the type of design elements we employ and
is influenced by the choice of architectural style

Plan driven approaches create much of the model before implementation
begins, whereas for agile forms, the details of the model evolve
dynamically.

# Architectural Style

<Definition name="Architectural Style">
Concerned with a high-level concept of widely used structures and relationships.
</Definition>

<Definition name="Architectural Form">
Concerned with the high-level design of a particular system
</Definition>

The concept helps analysis and understanding, but as with so many
aspects of software, this has proved a difficult one to describe in a
systematic manner

## What does software architecture do for us?

- Assists understanding, by giving a vocabulary that descries a
  systemâ€™s high-level design

- Enables reuse of software, by identifying where we might "match"
  different system elements

- Aids system evolution, by exposing the dimensions along which a
  system is expected to evolve. The maintainers can use this as a
  guide as to how the system can best be executed

- Provides a framework for analysis - allowing us to assess how well
  the solution will meet user needs

## Classifying architectural style

A simple and useful classification scheme is one based on the forms of
the following three elements:

- Components: the basic building blocks used in a system built in this
  style

- Connectors: the way the components interact

- Context: how the elements and their interactions are organised and
  managed at run-time

The context can also be characterised in terms of other features of a
system, such as:

- Topology of information and control flow

- Synchronisation mechanisms

- Binding time

## Evolution of architecture

- Early architectural styles tended to mirror the way that a computer
  operated, with a strong emphasis upon function

- Later styles show more balance between function and data

- But all are still used

## Major architectural styles

| Form                     | Dominated By                                                  | Examples                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Flow                | Motion of data, with no upstream content control by recipient | Batch sequential, pipe-and-filter                  |
| Call-and-return          | Order of computation, with a single thread of control         | Main program and subprograms, abstract data types  |
| Interacting-processes    | Communication among independent, concurrent processes         | Communicating processes, distributed objects       |
| Data-centered repository | Complex central data store                                    | Transactional databases, client-server, blackboard |
| Data-Sharing             | Direct sharing of data among components                       | Hypertext, lightweight processes                   |

## Data Flow examples

### Batch sequential systems

No user interaction, the program reads data from files and outputs to
new files:

- Components are the program itself any files it users

- Connectors are the run-time links to files

### Pipe-and-Filter

A chain of processes, which each filter the input data in some way, but
which also have clearly independent and reusable roles

- Components are the filter processes

- Connectors are the mechanism linking the standard output from one
  filter to the standard input of another

Unix processes and pipes are a classical example of this form
