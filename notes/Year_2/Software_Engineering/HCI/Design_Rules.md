title: Design Rules and Principles
---

3 Types:

- Design standards

- Design principles

  - Universal/heuristic

  - Specific

# Standards

"Rules" - with high authority. Specific to a particular type of design

Set by national or international bodies to ensure compliance by a large
community of designers

Hardware standards more common than software

Standards have high authority and a great amount of detail. In some
domains (e.g. safety critical design) failure to apply standards can
lead to disaster (or a legal case)

# Principles

- Over the years many principles of good interactive system design
  have been developed

- Design principles can be very broad such as "make things visible"

- They can be more specific such as "provide clearly marked exits"

- There are also good design principles that derive from psychology
  such as "minimise memory load"

- General, high level, design knowledge

- Principles are based on knowledge from many fields, particularly
  psychology, graphic design, cultural studies

- Abstract guidelines (universal principles) applicable during early
  design activities

- Detailed guidelines (specific principles) applicable during later
  design activities

# Principles and patterns

The application of design principles has lead to established patterns of
interaction in certain circumstances

Design principles can

- Guide the designer during the design process

- Can be used to evaluate and critique prototype design ideas

# Twelve principles for good human-centred interactive systems design

Learnability - A system should not be difficult to learn how to use

- Visibility

  - Try to ensure that things are visible so that people can see
    what functions are available and what the system is currently
    doing

- Consistency

  - Be consistent in the use of design features

  - Be consistent with similar systems and standard ways of working

  - This involves being consistent both internally to the system and
    externally as the system relates to things outside of it

- Familiarity

  - Use language and symbols that the intended audience will be
    familiar with

  - Where this is not possible because the concepts are quite
    different from those people know about, use a metaphor

- Affordance

  - Design things so it is clear what they are for

  - Affordance refers to the properties that things have and how
    these relate to how things could be used

  - Affordances are culturally determined

Ease of use

- Navigation

  - Provide support to enable people to move around parts of the
    system

- Control

  - Make it clear who or what is in control and allow people to take
    control

  - Control is enhanced if there is a clear, logical mapping between
    controls and the effect they have

- Feedback

  - Rapidly feed back information from the system to people so that
    they know what affect their actions had

Robustness

- Recovery

  - Enable recovery from actions, particularly mistakes and errors,
    quickly and effectively

- Constraints

  - Provide constraints so that people do not try to do things that
    are inappropriate

Accommodation

- Flexibility

  - Allow multiple ways of doing things to accommodate users with
    different levels of experience and interest in the systems

  - Provide people with the opportunity to change the way things
    look or behave

- Style

  - Designs should be stylish and attractive

- Conviviality

  - Interactive systems should be polite, friendly and generally
    pleasant
