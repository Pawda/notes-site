# The design of everyday things

How can we use knowledge of human psychology and physiology to help us
design better products

1.  Accordances

2.  Mappings

3.  Constraints

4.  Conventions

# Knowledge in the Head and in the World

Not all the knowledge required for accurate behaviour has to be in the
head. It can be distributed

- Partly in the head

- Partly in the world

Placing knowledge in the world (as part of the design of objects)

- Having knowledge in the world reduced the load on human memory

- An example of the input format can be provided in the interface
  "Please enter the date (yyyy/mm/dd)

# Embedded Knowledge

Good design should "embed" knowledge of how it is used in the design
itself

If a user has to remember "how to use" they will forget

The design of these things "suggest" how you use them as part of their
design

# Perceived Affordance

The perceived properties of the object that suggest how one could use
it

When simple things need pictures, labels or instructions, the design has
failed

# GUI Affordances

For screen-based interfaces, the computer already has built in physical
affordances

- Screen affords touching

- Mouse affords pointing

- Mouse buttons afford clicking

- Keyboard affords typing

Computer software/web pages can suggest on screen affordances by using
raised buttons, icons in the shape of sliders or knobs

# Mappings

Mappings are the relationships between controls and their effects on a
system

Natural mapping take advantage of physical analogies and cultural
standards

Examples:

- Turn steering wheel clockwise to turn a car right

# Constraints

Constraints are physical, cultural or logical limits on the number of
possibilities for an objectâ€™s use

- Physical constraints such as pegs and holes limit possible
  operations

- Cultural constraints rely upon accepted cultural conventions

Where affordances suggest the range of possibilities, constraints limit
the number of alternatives

# Conventions

Conventions are cultural constraints . They are initially arbitrary, but
evolve and become accepted over time. They can however still vary
enormously across different cultures

# Conceptual Models

Conceptual models are formed from:

- Affordances

- Mapping

- Constraints

- Familiarity with similar devices (transfer of previous experience)

- Instructions

- Interactions (trial and error)
