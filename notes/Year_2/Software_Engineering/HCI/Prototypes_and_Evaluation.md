# Prototypes

Prototypes can come in all shapes and forms

-   Early in the development process they may be made of paper, post-its
    or cardboard

-   Later they may be screen mock-ups or products with restricted
    functionality

-   Finally they may be more polished pieces of software, metal or
    plastic that represent the final product

<Definition name="Prototyping">
The process of building the interactive versions of the proposed product
</Definition>

A prototype allows users to

-   Interact with envisioned product

-   Gain experience of using it in a realistic setting

-   Explore imagined uses

A prototype is a limited representation that allows interaction and
helps users explore its suitability

## What is a prototype

An interaction design it can be (among other things):

-   A series of screen sketches

-   A storyboard

-   A powerpoint slide show

-   A video simulating the use of a system

-   A lump of wood

-   A cardboard mock-up

-   A piece of software with limited functionality

## What to prototype

Technical issues:

-   How feasible is the design

-   If you can’t make a mock up what hope is there for the full product

Screen layouts and information display

-   What will the screens look like?

-   How will information be displayed?

-   How does this affect the proposed interaction?

Difficult, controversial, critical areas

-   Remove ambiguity from the design

-   Clarify vague requirements

-   Force the developers to make concrete design decisions and see how
    they work

-   Can be difficult to get users to articulate exactly what they want

-   When presented with examples Stakeholders can see, hold, interact
    with a prototype more easily than a document or drawing

-   Allows developers to verify requirements

-   Prototypes answer questions, and support designers in choosing
    between alternatives

-   Team members can communicate effectively

-   It encourages reflection: very important aspect of design

-   You can test out ideas yourself

## Wireframe vs Mockup vs Prototype

<Definition name="Wireframe">
Basic illustrations of structure and components of a web page
</Definition>

<Definition name="Mockups">
Close or identical to the actual final web site design and include graphics - generally just image files
</Definition>

<Definition name="Prototypes">
Semi functional and generally give the client the ability to click around and simulate the way the site will eventually work
</Definition>

## Prototyping process

-   Very early in the process, you should develop paper prototypes-
    wireframes of screen designs - and walk through this with end-users

-   You then refine your design and develop increasingly sophisticated
    automated prototypes, then make them available to users for testing

## Low-fidelity Prototyping

Uses a medium which is unlike the final medium

Is quick, cheap and easily changes

-   Supports the exploration of alternative designs and ideas

-   Important for early stage of design

-   They are exploratory only

## Storyboards

Often used with scenarios, bringing more detail, and a chance to role
play

It is a series of sketches showing how a user might progress through a
task using the device

-   A series of sketched screens for a GUI interface

-   A series of scene sketches showing the user performing an activity

-   Used early in design

## High-fidelity programming

-   Uses materials that you would expect to be in the final product

-   Prototype looks more like the final system than a low-fidelity
    version

-   Danger that users think they have a full system - need to manage
    user expectations

Problems with high fidelity prototypes

-   They take too long to build

-   Reviewers and testers tend to comment on superficial aspects rather
    than content

-   Developers are reluctant to change something they have crafted for
    hours

-   A software prototype can set expectations too high

-   Just one bug in a high-fidelity prototype can bring testing to a
    fault

## Compromises in prototyping

-   All prototypes involve compromises

-   For software based prototyping

    -   Slow response

    -   Sketchy icons

    -   Limited functionality

-   Two common types of compromise

    -   Horizontal - lots of functions, little detail

    -   Vertical - Lots of detail, few functions

-   Compromises in prototypes mustn’t be ignored, product still needs to
    be produced

## Management of problems for prototyping

Time

-   Building prototypes take time

-   Needs to be fast - rapid prototyping. Careful this does not lead to
    rushed evaluation and erroneous results

Planning

-   Hard to adequately and cost a design involving prototyping

Non functional requirements

-   Such features sacrificed in prototypes

-   May be critical to product acceptance

Contracts

-   Design often bound by contractual agreement on technical and
    managerial issues

-   Prototypes are quick to change but this needs to be reflected in the
    requirements document which serves as the binding development
    agreement

## Key points

-   Prototyping is the process of building interactions of a proposed
    product

-   Used to gather formative evaluation results and feedback from users

-   Low fidelity prototypes are cheap and quick to develop and should be
    used early in the design for formalise requirements

-   High fidelity prototypes provide the look and feel of the final
    product and serve as a living specification

-   Need early consideration of the nature of the prototype

-   Prototyping can be difficult to plan and cost, and we must be aware
    of the non-functional components that may be missing

# Evaluation

## Goals of evaluation

-   To assess the extent of the systems functionality

-   To assess the effect of the interface on the user

-   To identify any specific problems with the system

## Why, what, where and when to evaluate

-   Why: to check users’ requirements and that users can use the product, and they like it

-   What: a conceptual model, early prototypes of a new system and
    later, more complete prototypes

-   Where: in natural and laboratory settings

-   When: Throughout design; finished products can be evaluated to
    collect information and to inform new products

## Types of evaluation

-   **Controlled settings** involving users

    -   Usability testing

    -   Living labs

-   **Natural settings** involving users

    -   Evaluate people in natural settings

    -   Goal to be unobtrustive

-   **Any settings** not involving users

    -   Researcher has to imagine or model how an interaction will take
        place

    -   Inspection methods used to predict user behaviours and identify
        usability problems

### Inspection methods

-   Heuristic evaluation

    -   Guides design or critique a decision. Critique based on
        principles and guidelines

-   Cognitive walkthrough

    -   Analysis of action sequences the user interface requires the
        user to perform

-   Analytics

    -   Measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of internet data

## Key points

-   Evaluation and design are closely integrated in user-centred design

-   Some of the same data gathering methods are used in evaluation as
    for establishing requirements, but they are used differently

-   Three types of evaluation. Controlled - laboratory based with users,
    Less controlled - in the field with users, studies that do not
    involve users

-   Usability testing and experiments enable the evaluator to have high
    level of control over what gets tested, whereas evaluations
    typically impose little or no control on participants in field
    studies
