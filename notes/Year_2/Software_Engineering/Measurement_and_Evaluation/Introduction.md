title: Introduction to Measurement and Evaluation
---

<Definition name="Measure">
Ascertain extent or quantity of a thing by comparison with fixed unit or with object of known size
</Definition>

<Definition name="Evaluate">
Assess the quality of something, preferably by assigning a numerical value to it
</Definition>

# Forms of measure

<Definition name="Quantitative">
Concerned with things that are countable, and independent of the observer
</Definition>

<Definition name="Qualitative">
More concerned with having the observer make judgements - and typically use ordinal scales
</Definition>

<Definition name="Indirect Measurements">
Things we can measure are combined to provide a "surrogate" measure for some attribute we can't measure directly
</Definition>

# Variation

In the physical sciences, repeated measurements will usually result in a
**Normal** distribution, with a bell shaped curve that is centred on the
mean

Where an experiment involves humans, the spread of values is more
complex and may well be asymmetric. We usually show this by using the
median as our centre point, as illustrated by box plots

# Software Metrics

Measurement science tends to differentiate between an attribute, which
we associate with some element, and a metric, which will be some
specific number and associated unit of measurement

When adopting a metric, we need a clear definition of the counting rules
used to measure its value

# Roles for metrics

<Definition name="Actionable Metrics">
Relate to things that we can control. We can then react to the values we measure for the metric by making changes
</Definition>

<Definition name="Informal (or unactionable) metrics">
Relate to things we can measure and they may matter to us, but we can't directly influence
</Definition>

# Why are metrics important

- For any software project, metrics an provide the means of control,
  to monitor how well our estimated values for such attributes as
  size, quality, dependencies etc. match the actual values that we
  measure

- In turn, making estimates also requires that we use such measures,
  because ultimately we need to determine how much effort a project
  needs and what levels of skill, and when it might be delivered

# Complexity

- Complexity is not an attribute in itself so must have a clear
  context of what attributes, or set of attributes we are referring to

- Complexity is a property of attributes such as control flow,
  information flow, coupling etc

- Therefore need some idea of what threshold value will be used to
  determine that something is considered as being complex.
