# Characteristics of a metric

- A metric not only needs to have a clear and relevant association
  with an attribute, its values need to change in accordance with our
  expectations when the attribute changes

- The problem here is that the attributes we tend to associate with
  describing software are often rather imprecise, and can mean
  different things in different contexts - so the rules for combining
  them might not always be clear cut

# What things do we need to measure?

Some examples of what we want to know about include:

- Code structure

- Control flow through code

- Information flow (and relationships)

- "object" properties

- Execution of code

- Steps in development

- Specifications

- Design properties

- Testing outcomes

# Attributes and Measures for Code

Two key attributes when thinking about development and evolution are:

- Size

- Relationships between elements

## Halsteadâ€™s Measures

Focused on counting lexical tokens in programs to extract measure like

- Number of unique operators

- Number of unique operands

- Total occur

- Total occurrences of operands

- Size of a program

## Lines of code

Widely used as a size metric as it is easy to measure, however it has
limitations:

- Do you count empty lines?

- Do you count comments

- Statements can be expanded onto more lines for readability

## Cyclomatic Complexity

Defined as

$$
V(G)=e-n+2
$$

or can also be computed as number of decision points+1

This means there is no penalty for writing more legible code

### Compound conditions

- Compound conditions are a problem for this as different routes could
  require different numbers of decisions

- The original rule treated any compound condition as a single
  decision

- There has been a suggestion of treating each element in a compound
  condition as a separate decision to get an upper bound
