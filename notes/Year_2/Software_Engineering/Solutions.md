# ISPs

ISPs are:

- Elusive, unbounded, no ’end’ conditions, not understandable

- Require orientation (context)

- Many stakeholders

- Many ’solutions’

## Solutions

- Generate your initial boundaries - these are mutable

- From the initial limits, decompose the problem into smaller problems

- Identify potential solution criteria for the sub-problems

- Feedback, consider and reframe

In SE a good problem solver need the following:

- **Method**: refers to a formal procedure; a formal "recipe" for
  accomplishing a goal that is typically independent of the tools used

- **Tool**: An instrument or automated system for accomplishing
  something in a better way

- **Procedure**: A combination of tools and techniques to produce a
  product

- **Paradigm**: A philosophy or approach for building a product

# Stakeholders

- Customer: The company, organization, or person who pays for the
  software system

- Developer: The company, organization or person who is building the
  software system

- User: The person or people who will actually use the system

# Where does the blame lie?

Four factors identified for a higher chance of success:

- User involvement

- Executive management support

- Clear requirement statements

- Proper planning

Three main factors identified in challenged or failed projects

- Incomplete requirements/changing requirements

- Lack of user involvement/input

- Lack of resources

# SE Code of Ethics

Code of ethics is not a formal checklist or exhaustive

- To help us develop an understanding of what is appropriate

- Ethical rules and codes can only be used effectively by persons with
  good judgement

- Good judgement is acquired experience, good habits and conscious
  attention to ethical issues

- Exemplary software engineers have been described as having the
  following characteristics:

  - Strong sense of individual responsibility; acute awareness of
    the world around them; brutal honesty; resilience under
    pressure; heightened sense of fairness; attention to detail
