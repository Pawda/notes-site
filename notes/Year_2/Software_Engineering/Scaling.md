What is an ultra-large-scale system:

-   More an ecosystem than system

-   1000s of stakeholders

-   Multiple user scenarios and requirements

-   Continuous integration

-   A wide variety of infrastructure and process integration

# Characteristics of large system development

-   Collections of separate, communicating systems, where separate teams
    develop each system

-   Development team spread over locations and timezones

-   Include and interact with a number of existing systems

-   Constrained by external rules and regulations limiting the way that
    they can be developed

-   Long procurement and development time

-   Diverse set of stakeholders

# Distributed teams

Create coherence:

-   Acknowledge bit and small cultural differences

-   Strengthen functional and team subcultures

Change how you communicate:

-   Cross team communication mechanisms have to be designed and used.
    This should involve regular phone and video conferences and frequent
    electronic meetings

-   Initial and quarterly face to face meetings

-   Stay together for as many iterations as possible

-   Need strong documentation

# Agile in large systems

Some attributes significant in applying Agile to large projects are:

-   Retain team sizes

-   Iteration length

-   Synchronised cadence

-   Batch size

-   Preserve PO and User role

# Scrum in large systems

Scrum of Scrums:

-   A team member from each scrum regularly attends the scrum of scrums
    to coordinate work

Large scale scrum:

-   Team focused on the whole product instead of individual parts

-   Only one sprint and backlog

-   One overall product owner

# Problems of large system development

-   Project managers may be reluctant to accept the risk of a new
    development approach

-   Quality procedures and standards that would be incompatible with
    agile methods

-   Large range of skill levels in large organisations

-   Cultural resistance to using agile

# Technical, human and organisational questions

-   Is it important to have a very detailed specification and design
    before moving to implementation

-   Is an incremental delivery strategy realistic

-   How large is the system being developed

-   What type of system is being developed

-   What is the expected system lifetime

-   What technologies are available to support system development

-   How is the development team organised

-   Are there cultural or organisational issues that may affect the
    system development

-   How good are the designers and programmers in the development team

-   Is the system subject to external regulation
