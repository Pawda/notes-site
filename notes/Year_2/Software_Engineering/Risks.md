Something involving choice and uncertainty based on incomplete information

The "cautious planner" school of risk management:

-   Identify risks in advance

-   Assess probability and impact

-   Prioritise

-   Risk management plan

Types of risk:

-   Project risks

-   Technical risks

-   Business risks

-   Known risks

-   Predictable risks

-   Unknown risks

A risk can be measured by its likelihood $\times$ the impact

A risk is an unwanted event that has negative consequences. Project
managers must engage in risk management to understand and control the
risks on their project

Distinguish risks from other project events by looking for:

1.  Loss associated with the event - risk impact

2.  Likelihood the event will happen - risk probability

3.  Degree to which we can change the outcome - risk control

There are two major sources of risk

-   Generic risk

-   Project risk

# Risk identification

May be team activities or based on the individual project managerâ€™s
experience

A checklist of common risks may be used to identify risks in a project

-   Technology risks

-   People risks

-   Organisational risks

-   Tools risk

-   Requirements risks

-   Estimation risks

# Risk analysis

-   Asses probability and seriousness of each risk

-   Probability may be very low, low, moderate, high or very high

-   Risk consequences might be catastrophic, serious, tolerable or
    insignificant

# Risk mitigation

Consider each risk and develop a strategy to manage that risk:

-   Avoidance strategies - the probability that the risk will arise is
    reduced

-   Minimisation strategies - the impact of the risk on the project or
    product will be reduced

-   Contingency plans - if the risk arises, contingency plans are plans
    to deal with that risk

# Risk monitoring

Assess each identified risks regularly to decide whether it is becoming
less or more probable

Risk monitoring tracks progress

-   Assess whether a predicted risk occurs

-   Assess whether the effects of the risk have changed

-   Ensures that risk aversion steps are defined and properly applied

-   Collects information that can be used in the future

Each key risk should be discussed at management progress meetings

When problems occur we need to be able to identify why
