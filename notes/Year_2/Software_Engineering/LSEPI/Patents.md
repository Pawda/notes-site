# Brief History of Patents in the UK

- ‘Letters patent’

  - An open document where the Crown granted a monopoly

    - to skilled individuals with new techniques for the
      production / sale of goods

    - Weaving of woollen cloths (1331)

- ‘Patent’

  - First recorded patent 1449 for the manufacture of coloured glass
    by John Utyman. Was first used in Eton College.

- Statutes of Monopolies 1624

  - An Act of the Parliament of England (to reduce the Crown abuse)

  - The basis for the UK’s intellectual property law

  - Restricted patents to inventions

    - 14 years in length

    - stipulated that the patent should not cause harm to trade

# Patent Law in the UK

- Patents Act 1977

  - The foundation of our current patent laws based on the European
    Patent Convention (1973)

    - Signed by 27 countries

# Modern Patents

- Most countries have patent laws for the protection of ‘inventions’

  - New

    - Not been “thought” of before, whether previously patented or
      not

  - Non-obvious

  - Protection for a “reasonable” period of time

    - Use

    - Manufacture

    - Import

    - Sell

- A patent can be also:

  - an “improvement” of an existing patent

  - an innovation that provides a “new use” for an existing
    invention

# Patent laws in the UK

- In the UK, patents last for at most 20 years

  - To get the full 20 years, a renewal fee must be paid every year,
    starting 5 years after the filing date.

- An invention can be registered for a patent if it:

  - is new

  - involves an inventive step-invention-shouldn’t be obvious

  - is capable of industrial application (technical effect)

    - not an idea or theory, a discovery, a work of art

  - is not in an area specifically excluded by the Patent Act 1977.

## Areas specifically excluded

- Scientific theories and mathematical methods

  - Gravity and floating point arithmetic

- Aesthetic creations

  - Literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work

- Presentation of information

- A newly discovered animal or plant

- A method of medical treatment or diagnosis

- A scheme / rule / method for performing a mental act, playing a game
  or doing business

- _Some_ computer programs

- Against public policy or morality

# Requirements for patent

- The inventor must not disclose information about the invention
  before the date of the patent application.

- Nobody, including the inventor, should use the invention before the
  patent application date.

- Officials at the Patent Office must search existing patent and
  literature.

# Benefits of patent protection

- the right to stop others from copying / manufacturing / selling /
  importing your invention

- make money by selling / licensing your invention

- safely discuss your invention with others

- others gain advanced knowledge of technology and can prepare and
  develop new inventions / patents

# Obtaining a patent

- Applying for patent can be expensive and time consuming. The World
  Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) offers a simplified
  process.

- The invention must be novel. The date of the patent application is
  crucial.

- Full patent specification must follow within 12 months of the
  initial application.

- Full patent specification needs to be prepared by a specialist
  patent attorney.

- Can take several years!

- Guidance to Patent:
  <https://www.gov.uk/guidance/patents-step-by-step>

- Before you apply for a patent:

  - check if your idea / invention can be called “truly novel” / if
    it has already been patented / can be considered as obvious

  - Novelty search (or: Patentability search)

    - done by you and/or professionals (specialized patent
      examiners)

  - UK Intellectual Property Office:
    <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office>

  - US Patent and Trademark Office: <http://www.uspto.gov/>

- Application for a patent to the Intellectual Property Office

  - Full description of the invention

  - Drawings

  - A set of claims defining your invention

  - Summary of all the technical features

# Enforcing a patent

If people infringe on your patent, they may challenge you for many
things

- Challenges:

  - no inventive step

  - prior art (background art, state of the art)

    - all information, in any form, publicly known before your
      application

  - information kept secret (usually) does not count as prior art
    (“trade secret”, “confidential / classified information”)

    - however, they _may_ claim “prior user rights” - been using
      before patent was granted,

  - and thus gain the right to continue using the invention

  - Resolving challenges

    - ask for a non-binding opinion (e.g. by the Intellectual
      Property Office)

    - mediation (professional patent attorneys)

    - hearings (to resolve a dispute between inventor and IPO or
      someone else)

# Software Patents

- In the USA patents are granted to software if:

  - it is part of a product that is itself eligible for a patent

  - it controls a process that has some physical effect

  - it processes data that arise from the physical world

- In Europe

  - European Patent Office (EPO)
    <https://web.archive.org/web/20180312052803/https://www.epo.org/news-issues/issues/software.html>

  - Under the EPC, a computer program claimed “as such” is not a
    patentable invention (Article 52(2)(c) and (3) EPC). Patents are
    not granted merely for program listings. Program listings as
    such are protected by copyright. For a patent to be granted for
    a computer-implemented invention, a technical problem has to be
    solved in a novel and non-obvious manner.

- Software patents have been controversial.

- The argument for and against software:

  - For: it is illegal and unfair that something is patentable if
    implemented in hardware but is not patentable if implemented in
    software

  - Against: the software industry has been very productive and
    successful mainly due to the efforts of small companies, where
    Patents are not helpful to them.

- Many patents that are granted are ‘bad’. Much software was written
  before the software patents were thought possible.

# A few Patent myths

- No point in getting a patent, can’t sue big companies.

- Can get worldwide patent

- The patent police can protect my invention

- A patent will make me lots of money
