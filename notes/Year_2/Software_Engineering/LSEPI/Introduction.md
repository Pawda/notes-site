# Law

- “The body of rules, whether proceeding from formal enactment or from
  custom, which a particular state or community recognizes as binding
  on its members or subjects...”

- …“a set of rules which form a pattern of behaviour of a given
  society”

- …‘a set of rules that can be enforced in a court’

- The laws are different in different countries. Examples:

  - Divorce

  - Sale of alcohol

# Criminal Law

- “represents society’s view of the minimum standard of acceptable
  behaviour”

- Criminal law defines:

  - What constitutes a crime

    - In general: behaviours prohibited by the state because it
      threatens / harms / endangers the public safety / welfare

  - The mechanisms for deciding innocence / guilt of an accused
    person

  - Appropriate punishment:

    - A range from which an authority makes a selection

    - Person must be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt

# Civil Law

- Deals with disputes between legal persons

  - A compensation may be awarded to the victim that has gone
    through the process of ‘incorporation’ by:

    - Royal Charter
      <http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/royal-charters/>
      (example: Durham University, 1837)

    - Act of Parliament <http://www.parliament.uk>

    - Registering as company

- Q. What constitutes a legal person?

  - A legal person could be companies and organisations, hence civil
    laws apply to them in the same way it applies to a natural
    person

- Court proceedings are known as _litigation_

  - Must be initiated by the party (_plaintiff_) of the dispute who
    feels wronged by the _defendant_

  - For a plaintiff to win a case, he/she/it must show that
    his/her/its claim is correct _on the balance of probabilities_
    (i.e. $> 50\%$)

# Criminal Law vs Civil Law

- Differences between criminal law and civil law relate to the
  standard of proof and burden of proof:

  - In criminal law, the court must prove the offender is guilty
    beyond all reasonable doubt. Where in civil law the plaintiff
    has to proof his/her/its claim is correct on the balance of
    probabilities.

  - In a criminal case, the burden of proof lies on the prosecution.
    The defendant is innocent until proved guilty. Whereas in a
    civil case, both parties present their argument and must the
    convince the court of their correctness. (probability of
    correctness is used to determine the winner)

# Where Does the Law Come From?

- Common Law

  - Not written

  - Based on previous rulings (precedents) by judges

  - Not found in other countries, e.g. in continental Europe

  - Experience shared between some countries (e.g. commonwealth
    countries)

- Statute Law

  - Written

  - Set by governments

    - Acts of Parliament - legislation

  - Some common law became statute law (e.g. the Theft Act 1968)

- Think of an example of a statute law related to computing

# The Legislative Process in the UK

- Two-chamber legislature

- The British legislature is know as “parliament”

- House of Commons (the lower house)

  - Democratically elected (650 MPs) every five years

  - Usually the initiator of a bill (but not always)

  - Will accept or reject changes made by the House of Lords

  - <http://www.parliament.uk/education/about-your-parliament/mps-lords-monarch/>

  - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlPSAOa4vR4>

- House of Lords (the upper house)

  - Aristocrats, life peers, bishops, hereditary peers

  - Approval of a bill will result in an Act of Parliament

  - Modification will result in the bill go back to the House of
    Commons

  - Democracy: it cannot disapprove a bill that has passed 2 times
    from the House of Commons

  - Normally small in size

# Public input to statute law

- Green Paper

  - Also known as consultation document

  - A discussion document intended to initiate public consultation
    on a particular topic: (participatory democracy)

  - Explains why the government wants to create a new law

  - Invites opinions / ideas / proposals from interested individuals
    / organizations (e.g. BCS) who have expertise in the topic

  - Example:
    <http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/copyright-infso/greenpaper_en.pdf>

- White Paper

  - More public consultation

  - However: more specific and detailed than the green paper

  - Signifies a clear intention of the government to pass a new law

# Act of Parliament

- A Bill
  (<https://www.parliament.uk/education/teaching-resources-lesson-plans/from-bill-to-law/>

  - A proposal for discussion in Parliament

    - Available for debate and modification

    - Intended for approval (by voting)

  - Primary Legislation

    - Law made by the legislative branch of the government
      (Parliament)

    - Discussed / debated

    - Parliament cannot examine every law in detail

  - Secondary Legislation (or delegated legislation)

    - Detailed regulation introduced without full discussion

    - Follows the marriage method (proposals placed in the House
      of Commons library)

    - Law allows the government to slightly change / update a law
      without pushing through a completely new Act of Parliament

    - e.g. Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988 (protecting
      semi-conductor chip design):
      <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/pdfs/ukpga_19880048_en.pdf>

* Royal Assent

  - The final step for a bill to become law (Act of Parliament) is
    the formal approval by the Queen

    - Power of veto (however: last veto in 1708)
