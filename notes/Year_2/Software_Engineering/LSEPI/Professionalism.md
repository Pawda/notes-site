# Common Characteristics of a Profession

- Education and training are required prior to being able to practice
  the profession

- Members of the profession:

  - decide the nature of this training

  - control the entry of new members to the profession

  - decide about certain standards of conduct to be followed

    - design mechanisms to enforce them

- The profession has one (or more) professional bodies

- A combination of formal education and training (experience) is
  necessary to “rise” within the profession

# Professional Bodies

- Started by people coming together because of shared interests in
  some activity, e.g.

- computers, law, science, photography, mathematics …

  - (a list of bodies in the UK:
    <http://www.careercompanion.co.uk/files/page_element/page_element/List_of_Professional_Bodies_mapped_to_career_interests.pdf>)

- BCS (Chartered Institute for IT) started in 1957

- The main goals of a body are to:

  - transfer knowledge / experience to its junior members

  - build stronger connections between its members (networking)

    - organize meetings / conferences

  - help members find jobs

  - provide professional advice to the members from other senior
    members

- Other main goals of a professional body:

  - to establish code of professional conduct

    - take disciplinary measures against those who breach the code

  - to represent the common interests against others, or protect
    them from others, who:

    - try to enter it without the proper knowledge, or practice it
      dishonestly

  - establish mechanisms for disseminating knowledge of good
    practice

  - setting standards of education and experience to be met by
    members

  - to advise the government about matters within their expertise,
    e.g.

    - to set up security standards for using some new technologies

    - to certify new products in the market

  - being member of a body “guarantees” that you satisfy some
    minimum professional quality standards

# Professional Bodies

- IET - _Institution of Engineering and Technology_ “Professional home
  for life for Engineers and Technologists”

- IEE - Institute of Electrical Engineers in the UK

- IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers “The
  world’s largest professional association for the advancement of
  technology”

- ACM - Association for Computer Machinery “Advancing Computing as a
  Science & Profession”

- BCS - the Chartered Institute for IT (Royal Charter in 1984)
  Formerly the British Computer Society (since 1957)

- EATCS - _European Association for Theoretical Computer Science_

- Royal Academy of Engineering

- ACL - Association for Computational Linguistics

# Protecting the public

- in the past, professional bodies received a royal charter (formal
  document) to be recognised, e.g. BCS was awarded a royal charter
  in 1984.

- In cases of public interest, Parliament may grant the members of a
  professional body some sort of “legal monopoly”

- This can be done in two ways:

  - Reservation of title

  - Reservation of function

<Definition name="Reservation of title">
You are not allowed to use some professional titles, if you are not a member of a particular professional body
</Definition>

<Definition name="Reservation of function">
You are not allowed to perform certain professional activities, if you are not ``qualified'' by a particular professional body
</Definition>

- In England & Wales, you are not allowed to audit the accounts of
  _public companies_ if you are not a member of:

  - the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Association of
    Certified Accountants

- Reservation of title and function could be required

  - Veterinary Surgeons Act 1996

    - you are not allowed to call yourself veterinary surgeon nor
      carry out surgical operation unless registered with the
      Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS)

  - in the USA, title and function reserved not to members of
    professional bodies but to those registered by a state
    government

  - in the UK, membership of the Architects Registration Board now
    replaces membership in the Royal Institute of British Architects
    as a requirement for calling yourself an architect

# Software Development as Engineering

- Software development and information systems usually regarded as a
  branch of engineering

  - people practising it are called engineers

- Engineering and software development share some characteristics

  - Engineers design and build a wide variety of objects

  - Designing and building objects must work properly and meet
    predetermined requirements (functionality, performance, and
    reliability)

  - designing and building objects must be completed within
    constrained time and budget

# Are we engineers in America?

- In the USA, Engineering is reserved both in title and function

- In the USA, it is illegal:

  - to call yourself an engineer in a state unless you are
    registered with the State Engineers Registration Board

  - do engineering work without the supervision of a registered
    engineer

  - for a company to have the word “engineering” in its name, unless
    they employ one or more registered engineers

- Academic degree programs with “engineering” in the title must be
  taught (mostly) by registered engineers

- Must have approved bachelor’s degree, 4 years experience working for
  a registered engineer, passed 2 eight hour public exams

# Are we Engineers in the UK?

- Neither the title nor the function of Engineer are reserved in the
  UK

- Engineering Council: <http://www.engc.org.uk/>

  - the UK regulatory body for the engineering profession

  - if you are registered, then you are “Chartered Engineer”

  - sets standards of education, experience and competency for:

    - initial registration

    - continuing registration

- Main objectives of the Engineering Council:

  - to advance education in science and engineering

  - to promote the practice of engineering for the “public good”

  - to advise the government and represent the UK internationally

  - to maintain a register of accredited programmes in Higher
    Education

  - license appropriate bodies to admit members to the register

- Useful link with many documents describing the standards of the
  Engineering Council:

  - <http://www.engc.org.uk/standards-guidance/standards/uk-spec/>

# International Recognition of Engineering qualification

- EU mobility directives

  - movement of qualified professionals in EU countries

  - This done through FEANI 1951 (European Federation of National
    Engineering Associations)
    <https://www.feani.org/feani/what-feani>

    - maintains a register of EU engineers (EurIng)

- Washington Accord 1989
  (<https://web.archive.org/web/20160306142535/http://washingtonaccord.org/>)

  - Australia, UK, New Zealand, USA, Canada, Ireland etc.

  - standards and procedures are used to accredit academic education
    of an engineer

  - the agreement is fairly limited to undergraduate levels

# Compulsory Registration of Software Engineers (SE)

- many disasters directly related to lack of professional competence
  of SEs

  - system Therac-25 in the USA

  - the London Ambulance System in the UK

- Dangers arising from professional incompetence led to calls for
  compulsory registration of SEs

- All software must be written by registered SEs

- Little progress in this direction has been made
