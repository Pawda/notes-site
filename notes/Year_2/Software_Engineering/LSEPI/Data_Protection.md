# Data Protection Overview

_What kind of data?_

- Data relating to an _identified_ or _identifiable_ **living**
  individual should not be collected without:

  - an explicit _purpose_

  - a _lawful basis_ for collecting and using the data.

- There are two strands of data protection and privacy regulation in
  the Western world:

  - the US approach (self-regulation and market forces)

  - the European approach (government regulation and strict laws)

# Data Protection Act 2018 (UK)

- A way for individuals to control their personal information

- Protects individuals from:

  - use of personal information:

    - by unauthorized persons

    - for purposes other than those identified when it was
      collected

    - for a longer period than needed

  - inaccurate personal information

  - irrelevant personal information

    - i.e. individuals have the right to have incorrect /
      irrelevant information corrected / deleted (e.g. Google
      case)

- Information Commissioner’s Office
  ([ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/))

  - regulates compliance with the Data Protection Act

# GDPR Terminology (EU)

- European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

  - Common European minimum standards that were agreed in 2016 and
    came into force 25th May 2018

  - Applies to organisations, not to personal use

- Data

  - Information that is

    - being processed automatically, or

    - is collected to be processed automatically, or

    - is recorded as part of a relevant filing systems.

- Personal data

  - Information that is or can be linked directly to an individual

    - Name, address, etc.

  - ID codes that can be linked to an individual

    - National Insurance Number

  - Must “relate to” the individual

# GDPR

- The GDPR applies to processing carried out by organisations
  operating within the EU. It also applies to organisations outside
  the EU that offer goods or services to individuals in the EU.

- Infringements of the basic principles for processing personal data
  could mean a fine of up to 20 million euros, or 4% of your total
  worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher.

# GDPR Terminology (EU)

- Data controller

  - The individual / authority who determines the purposes and means
    of the processing of personal data

  - May need to pay an annual fee to the Information Commissioner’s
    Office, depending on the type of processing

- Data processor

  - Anyone who obtains, records, stores, organises, transforms,
    transports, discloses, deletes, combines etc. data on behalf of
    the data controller

- Data subject

  - An individual identified or identifiable by personal information

# GDPR

- Member states must:

  - create legislation to ensure:

    - use limitation

    - purpose specification

  - set up a supervisory authority that will:

    - monitor the data protection level in the country

    - give advice to the government

    - start legal proceedings when regulation is violated

- Data Protection Act 2018 (updated from 1984, 1998) (UK)

  - Information Commissioner’s Office
    ([ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk/))

  - Data controllers’ and processors’ responsibility

  - 7 data protection principles

    1.  Lawfulness, fairness and transparency

    2.  Purpose limitation

    3.  Data minimisation

    4.  Accuracy

    5.  Storage limitation

    6.  Integrity and confidentiality (security)

    7.  Accountability

# GDPR

Certain types of data have extra protections:

- Criminal offence data

- Special category data e.g. information about an individual’s

  - race

  - ethnic origin

  - politics

  - religion

  - trade union membership

  - genetics

  - biometrics (where used for ID purposes)

  - health

  - sex life

  - sexual orientation

# Principle (a): Lawfulness, Fairness and Transparency

- You must have a valid reason (a _lawful basis_) to collect and
  process personal data

- You must not do anything with the data that is illegal

- You must use personal data in a way that is _fair_ i.e. you must not
  use data in a way that is

  - detrimental in an unjustified way

  - unexpected or

  - misleading to the individual concerned.

- You must be clear, open and honest with people from the start about
  how you will use their data

# Lawful Basis

- There are six lawful bases for collecting and processing personal
  data:

  - **Consent:** individual has given clear consent for you to
    process their data for a specific purpose (must be opt-in; can
    withdraw their consent at any time)

  - **Contract:** necessary to carry out a contract or if they have
    asked you to take steps before entering into a contract

  - **Legal obligation:** so you can comply with the law

  - **Vital interests:** protecting someone’s life (could be a third
    party, only applies if consent cannot be given)

  - **Public task:** to perform a task in the public interest that
    has a basis in law

  - **Legitimate interests:** necessary for your legitimate
    interests or those of a third party, unless there is a good
    reason to protect the individual’s interests that overrides
    these legitimate interests

- You need to determine which is most appropriate

- It may be difficult to switch to a different one later

# Principle (b): Purpose Limitation

- You must be clear from the start about _why_ you are collecting
  personal data and _what_ you intend to do with it.

- You need to document your purposes and include them in your privacy
  information for individuals

- You can only use the personal data for a new purpose if either this
  is compatible with your original purpose, you get consent, or you
  have a clear basis in law

# Principles (c)-(e)

3.  Data Minimization

    - You must ensure the personal data you are processing is:

      - adequate - sufficient to properly fulfil your stated
        purpose;

      - relevant - has a rational link to that purpose; and

      - limited to what is necessary - you do not hold more than you
        need for that purpose.

4.  Accuracy

    - You must take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data you
      hold is correct, up-to-date and not misleading

5.  Storage Limitation

    - data shall _not_ be kept longer than necessary

    - you must have a policy setting standard retention periods if
      possible

    - you should periodically review data you hold and erase or
      anonymise it when you no longer need it

    - exceptions apply if you are keeping the data for

      - archiving in the public interest

      - scientific or historical research, or

      - statistical purposes

# Principle (f): Integrity and Confidentiality

- Appropriate technical / organisational measures must be taken
  against unauthorised / unlawful processing and against accidental
  loss / damage / destruction of personal data

- In particular, you will need to:

  - manage your _security_ to fit the nature of the personal data
    you hold and the harm that may result from a security breach

  - be clear about _who_ in your organisation is responsible for
    ensuring _information security_

  - make sure you have the right physical / technical security,
    backed up by robust policies / procedures

# Principle (g): Accountability

- You are responsible for complying with the GDPR and you must be able
  to demonstrate you compliance

- There are a number of measures that you can, and in some cases must,
  take including:

  - adopting and implementing data protection policies

  - taking a ‘data protection by design and default’ approach

  - putting written contracts in place with organisations that
    process personal data on your behalf

  - maintaining documentation of your processing activities

  - implementing appropriate security measures

  - recording and, where necessary, reporting personal data breaches

  - carrying out data protection impact assessments for uses of
    personal data that are likely to result in high risk to
    individuals’ interests;

  - appointing a Data Protection Officer and

  - adhering to relevant codes of conduct and signing up to
    certification schemes.

- You must review and, where necessary, update the measures you put in
  place.

# Data protection - Not an Impediment to Life

In the autumn of 2003 a UK utility company stopped the supply of gas to
an elderly couple’s homes for non-payment of £140 — they died

The Information Commissioner’s Office made it plain that in their view
the protection of personal information such as unpaid bills could not be
seen as overriding the protection of life offered by the social
services.

# Rights

The GDPR provides the following rights to individuals:

1.  The right to be informed (about collection and use of their data)

2.  The right of access (a copy of their data)

3.  The right to rectification (correct inaccurate data and complete
    incomplete data)

4.  The right to erasure (to have personal data deleted, also known as
    “the right to be forgotten”)

5.  The right to restrict processing (e.g. while considering a
    correction to their data)

6.  The right to object

    - In particular, individuals have an absolute right to stop their
      data being used for direct marketing

7.  Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling

8.  The right to data portability (move, copy or transfer personal data
    from one IT environment to another)

    - only applies in certain circumstances e.g. if the lawful basis
      is consent or in performance of a contract and the processing is
      carried out by automated means

    - must be provided in a format that is

      - structured,

      - commonly used and

      - machine-readable (e.g. CSV, JSON, XML).

Requests to access, rectify, erase, restrict or object must be:

- replied to within 1 calendar month

- for free

- may be denied in certain circumstances

# Data Breaches

- Breaches must be reported to the ICO within 72 hours if there is
  risk to a person’s rights or freedoms

- All breaches should be documented regardless of whether they are
  reported

- Individuals must be informed of breaches without undue delay

# International Transfers

- The GDPR primarily applies to controllers and processors located in
  the European Economic Area (the EEA)

- Personal data can not be transferred to a country outside of the
  European Economic Area (EEA), unless that country ensures an
  adequate level of protection for the rights / freedoms of data
  subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.

- Before making a transfer:

  - consider whether you can achieve your aims without actually
    processing personal data

  - Example: if data is made anonymous, so that it is not possible
    to identify individuals from it (now or at any point in the
    future), then the data protection principles will not apply and
    you are free to transfer the information outside the EEA.

# Scenario

You have set up an online business and hold personal details of your
customers in a database. You use the data to email your customers
regarding forthcoming offers. An unauthorised person accesses the
database and alters product prices and some customers’ details.

_Discuss how the UK Data Protection Act 2018 relates to this scenario._

# Scenario (Possible points to consider)

- You should collect the data in a fair, lawful and transparent manner

- The data subjects (customers) should give you their consent to
  processing the data

- Make it clear to them how you are collecting their information

- Make it clear why you are collecting their information

- Offer them the chance to request the removal of their details

- Offer an opt-in tick box for them to confirm their consent to use
  their data

- Take appropriate security precautions

- Do not transfer the data unless customers gave you the permission to
  do so

- Can you share the data with anyone and anywhere in the world?
