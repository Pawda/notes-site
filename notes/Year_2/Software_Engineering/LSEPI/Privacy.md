# What is privacy?

- Privacy related to notion of access & ownership

- Access:

  - Physical proximity to a person

  - Knowledge about a person

- Edmund Byrne: _Privacy is a “zone of inaccessibility”_

- Edward Bloustein: _Privacy violations are an affront to human
  dignity_.

- Too much individual privacy can harm society.

# History of privacy

- Internal walls: most people didn’t have walls.

- Solo beds: One bed shared with the entire family, and guests.

- In 1776, US president’s comment on British right to search homes
  sparked the fight for independence: unjustified violation of
  privacy.

- Information privacy (1900s)

  - information about citizens were public (the first American
    census).

  - Post office and privacy: post card without envelope (cheap)

# The world has changed

- Privacy is the right to “being left alone”.

- We have our privacy as long as we are being left alone by other
  people, organisations or governments.

- In the era of technology, privacy is more about personal
  information, not physical boundaries.

# Do we have a right to privacy?

- “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his
  privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his
  honour and reputation.”

- “Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such
  interference or attacks.”

  - Article 12 - Respect for privacy, the home and the family.
    Universal Declaration of Human Rights, United Nations, 1948.
    <http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf>

- “Everyone has the right to respect for his or her private and family
  life, home and communications.”

  - Article 7 - Respect for private and family life. Charter of
    Fundamental Rights of the European Union
    <http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT&from=EN>

# Exaggeration of privacy

- Secrecy versus privacy: what is the difference between them?

- Solving crimes: would information disclosure violate privacy
  principles?

- Pressure on the nuclear family

  - Loss of pre-industrial age support structures

- Isolation and seclusion

  - meditation in isolation or privately?

- Loneliness

# Benefits from privacy

- Individuality

  - Separate ‘moral agent’ (capable of acting with reference to
    right and wrong)

  - Being yourself

  - Time without the public mask

- Invention and creativity

  - Focus

  - Silence

- Building relationships

  - Trust and friendship

    - Ladder of privacy (different amounts of personal information
      to different types of people)

    - Intimacy (How can companies meet the privacy requirements
      while developing an intimate relationship with their
      customers?)

# Privacy and cyber-technology

- Our privacy is affected by cyber-technology whether we owned or even
  used a networked computer.

- How much personal information can be acquired about us every day?

- Consider the way we have been watched every day almost everywhere.

- Also, consider, web-based applications such as Google Street View.

- Personal data, including our web-browsing interests, can be easily
  acquired by organisations. Do they always need our personal
  information?

  - What is the risk? Information can be sold to third parties!

- Privacy concerns now affect many aspects of our day-to-day lives
  (commerce, healthcare, work, etc.)

- There are many types of privacy:

  - Consumer privacy (privacy-related threats in e-commerce)

  - Employee/workplace privacy (invisible line managers)

  - Location privacy (RFID or GPS)

  - Medical/healthcare privacy (centralized electronic registry of
    medical records)

# Identify some of the ways that cyber-technology makes you concerned about your privacy.

- Amount of personal information that can now be collected

- Speed at which personal information can now be transferred and
  exchanged

- Duration of time in which personal information can now be retained

- Kinds of personal information (such as transactional information)
  that can be acquired

# Public safety or privacy

- Edward Snowden revealed US National Security Agency’s violation of
  privacy law.

- Prism (a surveillance programme) used for tracking online
  communication.

- UK spy agency taps fiber-optic cables.

- Angela Merkel ‘warns’ Barack Obama!

- Watchdog warns about the collection of Big Data with the
  proliferation of CCTV
  (<https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/14/public-faces-mass-invasion-of-privacy-as-big-data-and-surveillance-merge>)

  - in UK, 1 CCTV for every 14 people (we are caught 300 times by
    them daily). China has 1 CCTV for every 427,000.

# Technologies and Privacy

- Loyalty programs (club cards, rewards card, points cards)

  - data collection

- Body scanners

  - Image creation

  - Video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwsWAxo2xmo>

- ‘Black boxes’

  - Not just planes

# Surveillance

- CCTV

- Oyster Cards in London

- Loyalty Cards

- Email

  - Monitored

  - Public key cryptography - make the key available upon request

    - The assumption is refusal $\Rightarrow$ guilt

    - always morally correct?

# Monitoring you

- To ensure that organisation’s regulations and procedures are being
  kept

- To establish facts, e.g. by

  - cameras

  - agents

  - witnesses

- To prevent / detect crime

- To investigate / detect unauthorised use of telecommunication
  systems

- To ensure the effective operation of the system

  - phone services

- To determine whether a communication within business is personal

# Biometrics

- What might we measure

  - Easily visible characteristics

    - Height, weight, structure

    - Eye colour (Hair colour??)

    - Glasses, hearing aid, wheelchair user…

  - Getting a bit more personal

    - Fingerprints & handprints: recently: “ear-prints”,
      “walk-prints”?

    - Retinal scans

    - Ear lobe capillary patterns

    - Skull measurement

    - DNA

    - Voice recognition

# Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

- <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents>

- A framework for controlling the lawful interception of computer,
  telephone and postal and Internet communication.

- Government security and law enforcement authorities can intercept,
  monitor and investigate electronic data.

- Under the Act and the associated regulations, organisations (those
  providing telecommunication services) can monitor and record
  communications.

# Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

- <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents>

- The main purpose of the Act is to ensure that the relevant
  investigatory powers are used in accordance with human rights.

- These powers are:

  - the interception of communications;

  - the acquisition of communications data (e.g. billing data);

  - intrusive surveillance (in private homes/private vehicles);

  - covert surveillance in the course of specific operations;

  - the use of covert human intelligence sources (agents,
    informants, undercover officers);

  - access to encrypted data

# Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

- <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents>

- For each of these powers, the Act will ensure that the law clearly
  covers:

  - the purposes for which they may be used;

  - which authorities can use the powers;

  - who should authorise each use of the power;

  - the use that can be made of the material gained;

  - independent judicial oversight;

  - a means of redress for the individual

- Not all of these matters need be dealt with in this Act - in many
  cases existing legislation already covers the ground

- The Act will work in conjunction with existing legislation, in
  particular the _Intelligence Services Act 1994_, the _Police Act
  1997_ and the _Human Rights Act 1998_

# The act and the regulations are criticised

- Security experts and some sectors of the telecommunications industry
  argued that:

  - there are ways in which the act can be rendered ineffective

  - allowing the seizure of encryption keys will undermine the
    effectiveness of encryption systems.

# You should be able to:

- Identify a source that helps you gain an understanding of the UK’s
  public and government view on privacy

- Write at least 5 key points about privacy including:

  - Pros and cons of a society that favours privacy (with examples)

  - A summary of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000

- Examine your own view on privacy.

- Contrast and compare it to others outside of your immediate circle
  of family and friends. Perhaps different cultures learned from
  literature, travel, etc.
