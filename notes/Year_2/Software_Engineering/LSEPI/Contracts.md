# What is a contract

<Definition name="Contract">

An _agreement_ between two or more _parties_ (legal / natural
persons) that can be enforced in a court of law

</Definition>

-   All the parties must intend to make the contract - can’t fool people
    into signing

-   All the parties must be competent to make the contract:

    -   old enough

    -   sufficiently sound mind to understand what they are doing

-   There must be a (objectively determined) “consideration”, i.e. all
    parties must be:

    -   receiving something

    -   providing something

# Contracts in the UK

-   Contract law regulates every transaction:

-   Breach of a contract:

    -   failure to perform the obligations defined in a contract

    -   court can award compensation for damages

-   Mostly based on the Common Law i.e. based on past court decisions
    (precedence)

-   Contract law in the UK: a long history

    -   “well adapted to effectively handle disputes that arise in
        fulfilling commercial agreements” \[2\]

    -   Perfectly adequate legislation for traditional transactions

        -   e.g. supply of goods or computers

# Contracts in the UK

-   New technologies came recently into the market:

    -   internet

    -   e-commerce

-   Need for new regulations about new issues, as:

    -   electronic signatures
        (<http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/7/section/7>),

    -   which country’s law governs international transactions,

    -   …

# Fixed Price Contracts

-   Used when a company buys a _tailor made_ system (or _bespoke
    system_), i.e.

    -   a specially designed system that fits its needs

        -   just a single PC, or

        -   thousands of PCs in several cities

## Components

-   Consists of:

    -   A short agreement

        -   Signed by the parties of the contract

        -   Clearly states that anything said before is not binding

-   Contracts for small-scale development projects:

    -   may be much simpler

    -   often only exchange of letters (doesn’t need to be "formal")

-   The standard terms and conditions

    -   Normal terms under which the _supplier_ does business

-   A set of schedules state explicitly

    -   for suppliers: _what_ and _when_ items are to be supplied

    -   for customer: _when_ payments are to be made

-   Annex

    -   states precisely _what_ is to be provided

        -   source code / documentation / user training / software tools
            …

    -   additional stipulations

        -   refers to the requirements specification (separate document)

## Delivery

-   Software delivery is not simply delivering the source code which
    does what is required.

-   Important: contract should state a list of deliverables:

    -   Source code

    -   Command file for building or executing code

    -   Design documentation

    -   Reference manual, training manual, operating command etc.

    -   Software tool to help main the code

    -   User training

    -   Training for client’s maintenance

    -   Test data and test results

    -   etc.

## Ownership of rights

-   Ownership of rights:

    -   specifies what legal rights are passed by the software company
        to the client

-   Physical ownership:

    -   books / documents / computers / discs usually pass to the client

-   Software:

    -   potentially protected by Intellectual Property Rights

        -   copyright / design rights / trademarks / patents

-   Very important:

    -   explicitly state in the contract who has the rights

# Confidentiality

-   During the design of a tailor made system:

    -   both parties gain confidential information for the other party

-   Obligation of confidence

    -   Clause in a contract

    -   Separate non-disclosure agreements

    -   Subject to Intellectual Property law

# Payments and Penalties

-   Specified by the standard terms and conditions:

    -   periods to pay

    -   surcharge on overdue payments

-   In practice, such clauses are brought into effect only in extreme
    cases

    -   may destroy the goodwill between the two parties

-   Usually payment is done in phases

    -   it reduces the financial risk of the supplier against

        -   insolvency of the client

        -   any other cash flow difficulties

-   Annex:

    -   Payment tied to milestones, e.g.

        -   on signature of the contract

        -   at various points during the development

        -   on acceptance of software

        -   at the end of the warranty period

    -   Payment for delays and penalties

        -   client / supplier not fulfilling their obligations

# Acceptance procedure

Critical stage of the fixed price contracts

-   Provide the criteria for successful software completion

-   Client should provide fixed acceptance test and accepted result

-   Test set must be provided at or before acceptance procedure

-   Extra tests cannot be added once test set has been delivered

    -   To complete acceptance procedure in reasonable time

# Indemnity

<Definition name="Indemnity">

Supplier is led, unwittingly, to infringe IP of third party

-   Using proprietary software
-   Which party indemnifies the other for liability?

</Definition>

# Termination of a contract

-   Many reasons to terminate a contract:

    -   client chooses another company that covers his/her needs

    -   client does not need the services of the supplier anymore

-   The contract must specify:

    -   payment to the point of completed work

    -   costs of redeploying staff

    -   ownership of work products

-   Both parties may accept in the contract that:

    -   in the case of conflict (dispute), they will accept the decision
        of an independent arbitrator (e.g. from the BCS)

-   Arbitration Act 1996
    <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/23/contents>

# Arbitration

-   Going to court can be very expensive

-   Mainly law firms benefit from it

-   Contract should contain a clause the parties agree to accept an
    independent arbitrator’s decision

    -   The president of the BCS or the president of IEE

-   If arbitration is required it will take place in accordance with the
    Arbitration Act 1996

-   The Act of parliament defined the set of rules for arbitration that
    cover many eventualities

# Contract Hire

-   Supplier agrees to provide to a customer some staff with specific
    skills for an agreed rate

-   Payment is set at a fixed daily / hourly rate:

    -   based on skills and experience of staff

    -   terminated by either party at short notice (e.g. 1 week)

-   Supplier is only responsible to:

    -   provide competent staff

    -   replace missing / unsuitable staff quickly

-   Ownership of IP must be addressed.

## Consultancy

-   A version of a contract hire

    -   much simpler contract

-   Consultants are experts hired to:

    -   assess some aspect of an organisation

    -   propose solutions to problems

-   Fixed-price, usually small amount.

-   A report is delivered as the final product. Success measure is
    harder than products delivered in fixed-price contracts

### Main components

-   Confidentiality agreement

-   Terms of reference

    -   Important to refer to it to solve disagreements.

-   Liability

-   Control over the final version of the report

-   Usually no early termination of the contract:

    -   end product is usually a report

    -   difficult to prove that the services are not good

# Outsourcing

-   Handing over specific company functions to another specialized
    company

-   Contracts can be complex:

    -   how is performance to be monitored / judged

        -   what if not satisfactory

    -   rates and duration

    -   intellectual property rights

    -   transferring / removing own staff, previously doing this job

    -   contingency planning / disaster recovery

    -   Service level agreement - related to performance monitoring

# Licence agreements

-   Customers buy copies of software

-   There may be many different agreements

    -   To use one copy

    -   Run software on server, limiting the maximum number of users

    -   Use unlimited number of copies

-   Vendors concern:

    -   Not giving away its own rights

    -   Limiting customers’ use of the software

    -   Regular income from support activities

    -   Not liable for any defects

# Liability for defective software

-   Software suppliers always try to limit their contractual commitment
    for quality

-   In most contracts, their liability is limited to:

    -   the purchase price, or

    -   some fixed amount

-   Unfair Contract Terms Act (1977)
    <https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/284426/oft311.pdf>:

    -   sets some minimum limits of the liability of suppliers

    -   no limit if product defect causes death or injury

        -   important for safety-critical software

-   Courts may judge liability issues case-specifically:
