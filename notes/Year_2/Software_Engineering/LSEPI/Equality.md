# Equality Act 2010

<http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents>

- The Equality Act combines and strengthens a number of previous laws
  to help tackle discrimination and inequality

- N.B. It does **not** apply in Northern Ireland

- It protects against discrimination from **nine** _protected
  characteristics_.

- What are they?

  - age

  - disability

  - gender reassignment

  - being married and or in a civil partnership

  - being pregnant or on maternity leave

  - race, including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin

  - religious or philosophical belief

  - sex

  - sexual orientation

# Philosophical Belief

- To be recognised as a philosophical belief, a belief must satisfy
  the Grainger criteria:

  - Must be genuinely held

  - Must be a belief, as opposed to an opinion or viewpoint based on
    information

  - Must be a belief as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human
    life and behaviour

  - Must have a level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and
    importance and

  - Must be worthy of respect in a democratic society and not be
    incompatible with human dignity or conflict with the fundamental
    rights of others

* The act protects from discrimination:

  - at work

  - in education

  - as a consumer

  - when using public services

  - when buying or renting property

  - as a member or guest of a private club or association

  - if you’re associated with someone who has a protected
    characteristic, for example a family member or friend

  - if you’ve complained about discrimination or supported someone
    else’s claim

# Types of Discrimination

- Discrimination can come in a number of forms:

<Definition name="Direct Discrimination">
Treating someone with a protected characteristic less favourably than others
</Definition>

<Definition name="Indirect Discrimination">
Putting rules or arrangements in place that apply to everyone, but that put someone with a protected characteristic at an unfair disadvantage
</Definition>

<Definition name="Harassment">
Unwanted behaviour linked to a protected characteristic that violates someone's dignity or creates an offensive environment for them
</Definition>

<Definition name="Victimisation">
Treating someone unfairly because they've complained about discrimination or harassment
</Definition>

- However, it **can** be lawful to have specific rules or arrangements
  in place, as long as they can be justified (if it is a
  “proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim”)

# Positive Action

- You can do something voluntarily to help people with a protected
  characteristic. This is called _positive action_.

- Taking positive action is legal if people with a protected
  characteristic:

  - are at a disadvantage

  - have particular needs

  - are under-represented in an activity or type of work

- Positive action can even be used in hiring practices.

* The law protects you against discrimination at work, including:

  - dismissal

  - employment terms and conditions

  - pay and benefits

  - promotion and transfer opportunities

  - training

  - recruitment

  - redundancy

* Some forms of discrimination are only allowed if they’re needed for
  the way the organisation works, for example:

  - a Roman Catholic school restricting applications for admission
    of pupils to Catholics only

  - employing only women in a health centre for Muslim women

* You’re also protected from being treated unfairly because of:

  - trade union membership or non-membership

  - being a fixed-term or part-time worker

# Disability

- If you’re disabled you have the same rights as other workers.
  Employers should also make _reasonable adjustments_ to help disabled
  employees and job applicants with:

  - application forms, for example providing forms in Braille or
    audio formats

  - aptitude tests, for example giving extra time to complete the
    tests

  - dismissal or redundancy

  - discipline and grievances

  - interview arrangements, such as providing wheelchair access,
    communicator support

  - making sure the workplace has the right facilities and equipment
    for disabled workers or someone offered a job

  - promotion, transfer and training opportunities

  - terms of employment, including pay

  - work-related benefits like access to recreation or refreshment
    facilities

- If you think you’ve been unfairly discriminated against, what can
  you do?

  - complain directly to the person or organisation

  - use someone else to help you sort it out (called ‘mediation’ or
    ‘alternative dispute resolution’)

  - make a claim in a court or tribunal

  - Can also talk to:

    - Acas (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service),

    - Citizens Advice or

    - a trade union representative.

# Exceptions

- Priests, monks, nuns, rabbis and ministers of religion.

- Actors and models in the film, television and fashion industries (a
  British Chinese actress for a specific role, for instance).

- Special employment training programmes aimed at ethnic minorities,
  ex-offenders, young adults, the long term unemployed, or people with
  physical or learning disabilities.

- Employment where there are cultural sensitivities (such as a
  documentary where male victims of domestic violence need to be
  interviewed by a male researcher, or a gay men’s domestic violence
  helpline).

- Where safety or operational efficiency could be jeopardised.

# Exceptions

- Political parties who use ‘protected characteristics’ (age, race,
  religion, sex, sexual orientation) as candidate selection criteria;
  though these ‘Selection arrangements do not include short-listing
  only such persons as have a particular protected characteristic’ –
  other than sex, which may still be used to prejudice selection in
  some circumstances (e.g. all-women/all-men shortlists).

- Local support staff who work in embassies and high commissions, by
  virtue of diplomatic immunity.

- Where national security could be jeopardised.
