## Tracking Progress

- Do we understand customer’s needs?

- Can we design a system to solve customer’s problems or satisfy
  customer’s needs?

- How long will it take to develop the system?

- How much will it cost to develop the system

## Project Scheduling

1.  Capturing and Sequencing Activities

2.  Assigning resources and establishing durations

3.  Verifying the schedule and critical path

4.  Conducting a schedule risk analysis

5.  Updating the schedule

6.  Maintaining a baseline schedule

- Understand how to plan, monitor and control projects using PERT/CPM

  - Program Evaluation and Review Technique

    - A graphic representation of a project’s schedule

    - Shows the sequence of tasks

    - Shows which tasks can be performed simultaneously

    - Pert applies a 3-point weighted average duration estimate

      $$
      T_e=(T_o+4\times T_m + T_p)\div 6
      $$

      $T_e$ = Expected Duration

      $T_o$ = Optimistic Duration

      $T_m$ = Most Likely Duration

      $T_p$ = Pessimistic Duration

  - Critical path method

    - Analysis of path among milestones

    - Identify minimum amount of time to complete the project

    - Reveals those activities that are most critical to
      completing the project on time

    - Calculate available time, real time and slack time as well
      as latest and earliest start time

- Determine the earliest finish, the latest start, the latest finish
  and slack times for each activity

- Understand the impact of variability in activity times on the
  project completion time

## Schedule Risks

A schedule is one of the project drivers that is most susceptible to
risk

- Schedules comprise multiple inter-dependant activities, each of
  which usually contain multiple uncertainties

- _Proactive scheduling_: Add time up front to deal with uncertainties

- _Reactive scheduling_: Incorporate a process to react to and absorb
  disruptions

- Mainly affects the critical path - other disruptions can often be
  easily absorbed

- Therefore it is important that the critical path is protected
