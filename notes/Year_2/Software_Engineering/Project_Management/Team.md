## Skills Audit

A clear understanding of not only your role but what are the strengths
and weaknesses of your skill set is vital

## Four Stages of Competence

**Unconscious Incompetence** - You are unaware of the skills and your
lack of proficiency

**Conscious Incompetence** - You are aware of the skill but not yet
proficient

**Conscious Competence** - You are able to use the skill, but only with
effort

**Unconscious Competence** - Performing the skill becomes automatic

# Ideation

Empathise:

-   Gain an understanding of the problem, normally through user research

-   Crucial to a human centred design process (P.A.C.T.)

Define:

-   Analyze your observations and synthesize them to define the core
    problems

-   Define sub-problems

Ideate:

-   Generate ideas

-   Lateral thinking stage

-   Often the innovation stage, especially if you can put your own
    assumptions and prejudices behind you

Ideation Approaches:

-   **Brainstorming** - You build good ideas from each other’s wild
    ideas

-   **Braindumping** - This is like brainstorming, but don individually

-   **Brainwriting** - This is like brainstorming, but everyone writes
    down and passes ideas for other others to add to before discussing
    these

-   **Worst Possible Idea** - You take an inverted brainstorming
    approach, emboldening more reserved individuals to produce bad ideas
    and yielding valuable threads

-   **Challenging Assumptions** - You overturn established beliefs about
    problems, revealing fresh perspectives

-   **Mindmapping** - You use this graphical technique to connect ideas
    to problems’ major and minor qualities

-   **Bodystorming** - You use role-playing in
    scenarios/customer-journey steps to find solutions

-   **Provocation** - You use an extreme lateral-thinking technique to
    challenge established beliefs and explore paths beyond
