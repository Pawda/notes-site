title: SCRUM
---

The Scrum process is suited for projects with rapidly changing or highly
emergent requirements. Its focus is on managing iterative development
rather than specific agile practices.

Scrum is empirical in that it provides a means for teams to establish a
hypothesis of how they think something works, try it out, reflect on the
experience, and make the appropriate adjustments

When to use

-   SCRUM is best suited in the base where a cross functional team is
    working in a product development setting where there is a non
    trivial amount of work that lends itself to being split into more
    than one 1-4 week iteration

# Roles

<Definition name="Product Owner (PO)">
Single person who has the vision behind the product dev; makes a final call on what the priorities of the work are: what is top of the list in the sprint backlog; makes business decisions focused on what not how and people go through him/her to the team
</Definition>

<Definition name="Scrum Team">
No hierarchy; 4-9 people ideally; build a shippable product in each sprint; each sprint they improve and collaboration increases between the team
</Definition>

<Definition name="Scrum Master (SM)">
Has NO managerial authority over the team; facilitates team needs without authority. Protects teams from distractions and interruptions; and teaches people to use scrum, good engineering practices, and enforces time boxes.
</Definition>

# Sprint

-   The starting point for planning is the product backlog (user
    stories), which is the list of work to be done on the project

-   Once these are agreed, the team organise themselves to develop the
    software - the team creates a spring backlog (their to-do list for
    the sprint). At the end of the sprint, the work done is reviewed and
    presented to stakeholder. The next sprint cycle then begins

# Artifacts

<Definition name="Scrum Product Backlog(SPB)">
A list of all things that need to be done within the project. It replaces the traditional requirements specification artifacts. These items can have a technical nature or can be user-centric e.g. in the form of user stories
</Definition>

-   Each scrum product backlog has certain properties that differentiate
    it from a simple to-do list:

    -   An entry in the SPB always add value for the customer

    -   The entries in the SPB are prioritized and ordered accordingly

    -   All entries are estimated

    -   The SPB is a living document (priorities shift)

    -   There are no action-items or low-level tasks in the SPB

    -   SPB entries can be scenarios or use cases

# SPB items (SPBI)

-   What you have agreed to do (SPBI) in the current sprint; has an end

-   How is breaking the SPBIs into small pieces - sprint tasks

-   These tasks can be tested

# Meetings

Sprint planning:

-   Plan one sprint. PO and team decide what SPBIs go into sprint
    backlog (have top priorities); try to get it clear what they have to
    do and how much they can do in the time allocated (timebox)

-   Use story points - arbitrary measure of effort required

Daily scrum:

-   Meet daily; 15 minute stand up and report to each other NOT to the
    PO or SM

-   What you did yesterday, what you will do today, what problems have
    you got

Sprint review:

-   Demo potentially shippable product increment to PO and anyone
    interested. PO declares what is complete and what doesn’t satisfy
    user requirements

Retrospective meeting:

-   At the end of every sprint what went well, what can be improved,
    what you have learned, feedback to each other - teams take ownership
    of the process

Refinement meeting:

-   Team and PO look ahead a little at the PBI’s to determine possible
    candidates and maybe break some down for the next couple of sprints.
    This can also be done in the sprint planning meeting

# Estimation

How much effort is involved:

-   Focus is on the collective effort not the individual effort per task

-   Teams can compare items to each other or estimate in relative units

-   Teams breaks it into the smallest possible stories

Velocity:

-   Measure of work completed by the development team in a given sprint

-   Is based on your estimated targets

# Advantages

-   The product is broken down into a set of manageable and
    understandable chunks

-   Unstable requirements do not hold up progress

-   The whole team have visibility of everything and consequently team
    communication is improved

-   Customers see on-time delivery of increments and gain feedback on
    how the product works

-   Trust between customers and developers is established and a positive
    culture is created in which everyone expects the project to succeed

# Disadvantages

-   It can be difficult to keep the interest of customers who are
    involved in the process

-   Prioritising changes can be difficult where there are multiple
    stakeholders

-   Maintaining simplicity requires extra work

-   Contracts may be a problem as with other approaches to iterative
    development

-   Team members may be unsuited to the intense involvement that
    characterises agile methods
