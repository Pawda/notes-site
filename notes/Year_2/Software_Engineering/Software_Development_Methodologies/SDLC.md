-   The SDLC framework is used in industry to design, develop and test
    high quality software

-   Focussing on creating software that meets the needs and expectations
    of the client

-   Within the client’s timeline and budget

# Phases

## Planning and RE(requirements) analysis

-   Planning is the first and most fundamental of the phases

-   Get this wrong and nothing else will work

-   Inc. quality assurance and risk analysis

Stakeholders/Roles within this phase

-   Client

-   Customer

-   Approver (managerial oversight)

-   Assessor (some degree of technical expertise to advise)

Outcome

-   An approved proposal

-   A functional requirements doc

## Design

-   The goal here is to create the s/w design document(s) based on the
    inputs from the previous phase (planning and analysis)

-   Perform design discussions, examine design patterns, consider
    requirements

-   Output: systems design docs for DB, API, application,
    infrastructure, testing, training, maintenance, user ...

Roles:

-   **End user** - final users of system

-   **Business analyst** - provide requirements to the design team,
    review solution design and artefacts

-   **Project Manager** - Finalize data conversion strategy and test
    strategy, review solution design and artefacts

-   **Technical-Architect, Tech-Designer, Design-Team** - Design system
    architecture, software components, etc; design walk-through

-   **Developer/Construction Team** - Assist with identifying and
    finalizing testing strategy; review of the architecture and software
    components

-   **Database team** - Assist with architecture design and data
    conversion strategy

## Implementation

-   Get your hands dirty with coding

-   Your teams may use any approach that works for you

-   Within a business you will have to abide by their coding guidelines

Roles:

-   **Customer**, sponsor and signs off team effort; review progress
    with the developers and the PM.

-   **Project Manager**, resolve resource, scheduling, budget issues;
    review and report progress.

-   **Developer**, construct a working solution from the approved
    design; produce artifacts and put them under configuration control
    and perform change control; employ tools, systems and conform to
    prescribed standards (platforms, coding practices, programming
    languages, etc) that are in line with the organization’s objectives.

-   **Database Administration Group**, assist with implementing the
    solution design and data conversion strategy.

-   **Implementation supervisor/manager**, assist with identifying the
    requirements for implementation of the solution (which includes
    system readiness, resources, time-lines).

-   **Integration supervisor/manager**, identify how integration of the
    solution in a new hardware/software  environment would be achieved;
    what tests are required to evaluate integration.

## Testing & Integration/Deployment

-   These phases are sometimes separated

-   The goal of testing is to check that the development is functional
    and meets requirements

-   Complexity arises from integration of a novel system with existing
    (sub-)systems

-   Test for various functional attributes

    -   Security, conformance, accessibility, performance, stress

Roles:

-   **Project Manager**, resolve resource, scheduling, budget issues;
    review and report progress.

-   **Developer**, assist with building tests and analysis of test
    results.

-   **Database Administration Group**, assist with integration of the
    solution design and data conversion tests.

-   **Implementation manager**, assist with analysis of test results.

-   **Integration manager**, assist with analysis of test results.

Sign off is completed when the functional requirements specification has
been met

## Implementation

-   Some versions of the SDLC have an additional phase here

-   The focus is to install the system in the production environment and
    to bring it into **operation**; and then to ensure that the system:

    -   Satisfies the functional requirements

    -   Satisfies the business needs

    -   Adheres to all mandates, physical constraints and service level
        agreements

    -   Operates as described in the User and Operator Manuals

## Maintenance

-   On successful operational transfer of the project, development group
    hands over to the maintenance group

-   Documentation must be ready for transfer at this time

-   Roles:

    -   **Solution Delivery Team** – Prepares all solution documentation
        and manuals for the maintenance group.  The solution delivery
        team will supply any requested training to help maintenance team
        technicians learn the solution’s behaviours

    -   **Solution Maintenance Team** – Reviews all solution
        documentation and supports the solution until the terms of the
        maintenance agreement expire

# Alternatives

There are many correct models depending on the people and project. The
SDLC just outlines the phases
