# Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and
helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

- Working software over comprehensive documentation

- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

- Responding to change over following a plan

# Principles

1.  Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
    continuous delivery of valuable software

2.  Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
    processes harness change for the customerâ€™s competitive advantage

3.  Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a
    couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale

4.  Business people and developers must work together daily throughout
    the project

5.  Build projects around motivates individuals. Give them the
    environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job
    done

6.  The most efficient and effective way of conveying information to and
    within a development team is face-to-face conversation

7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress

8.  Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
    developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace
    indefinitely

9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    enhances agility

10. Simplicity - the art of maximising the work not done - is essential

11. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from
    self-organising teams

12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
    effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly

# User stories

<Definition name="User Stories">
User stories are part of an agile approach that helps shift the focus from writing about requirements to talking about them. All agile user stories include a written sentence or two and, more importantly, a series of conversations about the desired functionality
</Definition>

- Captures the spirit

- Ignores details

- Make sense to customer

- Delivers value to customer

- End to end (full stack)

- Independent

- Testable

- Small (1-5 days) so easy to estimate

## Behaviour Driven Development

<Definition name="Behaviour Driven Development">
An agile process what supports and encourages collaborative development
</Definition>

Built on TDD (Test Driven Development) and ATDD (Acceptance TDD), plus:

- Where to start in the process

- What to test and what not to test

- How much to test in one go

- What to call the tests

- How to understand why a test fails
