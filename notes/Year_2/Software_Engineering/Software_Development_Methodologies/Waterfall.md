- Plan vs course change

- The waterfall model is often considered out of date

- Not an inflexible process but often created an inflexible instance
  (process vs people)

- Planning allows for more oversight and control

When to use:

- Requirements very well documented, clear and fixed

- Product definition is stable

- Technology is understood and is not dynamic

- There are no ambiguous requirements

- Ample resources with required expertise are available to support the
  product

- The product is short

# Advantages

- Simple and easy to understand and use

- Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model. Each phase has
  specific deliverables and a review process

- Phases are processed and completed one at a time

- Works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well
  understood

- Clearly defined stages

- Well understood milestones

- Easy to arrange tasks

- Process and results are well documented

- Iteration occurs within activities

# Disadvantages

- No working software is produced until late during the life cycle

- High amounts of risk and uncertainty

- Not a good model for complex and object-oriented project

- Poor model for long and ongoing projects

- Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at a moderate
  to high risk of changing. So, risk and uncertainty is high with this
  process model

- It is difficult to measure progress within stages

- Can’t accommodate changing requirements

- Adjusting scope during the life cycle can end a project

- Integration is done as a "big-bang" at the very end, which doesn’t
  allow identifying any technological or business bottleneck or
  challenges early
