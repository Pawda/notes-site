# Kanban Boards

Used to track itemised work at any level:

-   Arrangement of columns to track work progress

-   Each column represents a step in the development process

-   Each user story tracked across the columns

-   Used to define next steps to be completed

-   Easy to identify progress and bottlenecks

# Introduction to other models

<Definition name="Incremental Funding">
An ROI-informed approach to software development in which software is developed and delivered in carefully prioritized chunks of customer valued functionality. These chunks are known as Minimum Marketable Features (MMFs).
</Definition>

<Definition name="Chaos Model">
The phases of the life cycle apply to all levels of projects, from the whole project to individual lines of code. The main rule isÂ always resolve the most important issue first.
</Definition>

<Definition name="Behaviour Driven Development">
Agile SD process encouraging collaboration between stakeholders
</Definition>

<Definition name="Structures systems analysis and drsign">
A waterfall method for the analysis and design of information systems.
</Definition>

<Definition name="Unified Process">
An iterative and incremental software development process framework
</Definition>

<Definition name="V-Model">
Demonstrates the relationships between each phase of the development life cycle and its associated phase of testing
</Definition>

<Definition name="Lightweight">
A software development method that has only a few rules and practices, or only ones that are easy to follow, such as Crystal Clear
</Definition>

<Definition name="Slow Programming">
A SD philosophy that emphasises careful design, quality code, software testing and thinking. It strives to avoid kludges, buggy code, and overly quick release cycles
</Definition>

# RAD(Rapid Application Development)

-   Allows for greater flexibility than waterfall, but not as much as
    agile

# Spiral

-   Linear model

-   Risk analysis - Make sure you are able to complete the part of the
    spiral before the next analysis

# Not a Software Development Model

-   ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) v4

-   Linked to DevOps, Agile and Lean

-   Service - Providing benefit to a person

-   Value - Return on what you are putting in
