# Computing n!

_Imperative style:_

```python
for i in range(1, n+1):
    factorial=factorial * i
```

_Functional Style_

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*factorial(n-1)
```

# What is a functional language

A style of programming where the building block of computation is an
application to arguments.

# Side effects

**Side effect** - Modify some (internal/hidden) state as well as
returning a value

An example of this:

`y1=f(1)`

`y2=f(2)`

You would expect `y1==y2`, however if f has an internal state that
affects the answer this will not be true

```python
state=0
def f(n):
    global state
    state +=1
    return n+ state

print(f(1))=> "2"
print(f(1))=> "3"
```

# A functional approach

-   Forbid variable assignment and side effects in the language "pure
    functional"

-   Makes reasoning about code simpler (for humans and compilers)

-   A new programming paradigm: takes some time to get used to

# Why programming languages

## Abstracting from the machine

$$b=a+3$$

```nasm
mov addr_a, reg1; Load address of a into reg1
add 3, reg1, reg2; add 3 to reg1 and write into reg2
mov reg2, addr_b; write reg2 to address of b
```

-   Explicit about what is going on

-   Obfuscates algorithm from implementation

-   Not portable (would need different instructions for different
    hardware e.g. different registers)

-   Not easy to modify

-   Not succinct

## Programming languages

-   Allow writing code to an abstract machine model

-   A translator of some kind (perhaps a compiler) transforms this code
    into something that executes on some hardware (sometimes this
    hardware is a virtual machine)

-   Some virtual machines are "hybrid": they do just-in-time compilation

-   The Haskell distribution we will use has both Compiler and
    Interpreter mode

-   Micro-architecture just reads an instruction stream

-   Note easy to program complex algorithms in such a "language" so use
    abstractions leading to high level languages

-   Features driven by programming paradigm considerations, domain
    knowledge, wanting to target particular hardware...

-   Compiler or interpreter maps this language onto machine instructions

-   Therefore we need a formal specification

# Example

```hs
filter:: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter p [] = []
filter p (x:xs)
    | p x   = x: filter p xs
    | otherwise = filter p xs
```

-   Higher order

-   Polymorphic (works for all types a) (functions that take functions
    as parameters)

-   Function defined with recursion and pattern matching

# Syntax and Semantics

**Syntax** - What are valid sentences (expressions) in a language?

**Semantics** - What do these valid sentences (expressions) mean?

# Naming Requirements

-   Can have characters in function names, for example `xâ€™`

-   s at the end to show a list

-   lowercase letter to start

# Comments

```hs
-- Comment like this
{- Or like this if you have multiple
lines -}
```
