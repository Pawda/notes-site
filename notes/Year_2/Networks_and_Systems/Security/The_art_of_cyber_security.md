# Who really are the adversaries?

- Ransomware

- Industrial espionage

- Database breach

- Botnets, fast flux, domain flux

- Spam

- Keyloggers

- Rootkits

- Man in the browser

# The economy

- Bitcoin transactions change cyber landscape by enabling anonymous
  transactions

Economy can have fairly deep hierarchies, for example:

- Hacker steals 1000 Fullz (credit card and CCV and name and address)

- Sells on Tor forum for 1 BTC

- Buyer sells groups of 20 to cashiers

# Planning strategies

With the advent of machine learning, strategies are more intelligent
based on large scale analytics

- Open source intelligence (OSINT)

- Sentiment analysis

- Targeted advertising

- Identifying criminals and threats

# Spies - Can "we" stay anonymous

VPNs can be used to hide your IP address, or TOR can be used to increase
anonymity

# Security Operations Center (SOCs)

Teams proactively monitor the infrastructure

Tools/communities:

- Alien Vault

- Snort

- SNAIL

- OSEC

- OTX

- Logrhythm

# Security Information and Event Management

Third party monitoring (Â£8k/year)

Log rhythm:

- Create rules for alert types

- People review alerts and report back

- Cost depends on the level of monitoring they want

# High Availability Pair

2 firewalls in active-active pair (means e.g. VOIP availability during
updates) Network/switches updated out of hours

1.  Verify HA functionality before an upgrade
