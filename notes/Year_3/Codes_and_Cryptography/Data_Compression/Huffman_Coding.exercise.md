Let $\mathscr{X}=\{x_1,...,x_q\}$ for $q\geqslant 2$. Give a binary code $C:\mathscr{X}\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ that is uniquely decodable but neither prefix nor suffix

<Question>

How could you make the decoding algorithm of prefix codes more efficient? Would you use that modification for decoding Huffman codes? How would you include the decision problem: Given $w\in\mathscr{D}$, determine whether $w$ is a codeword

<Question>

Let X have probabilities $(1/3,1/3,1/4,1/12)$. Show that, depending on how you merge, the binary Huffman coding procedure may lead to different code lengths. Namely (2,2,2,2,) or (1,2,3,3). Verify that the average length stays the same
